# Path\_Solver

This project is a visualization of dijkstra's algorithm with an ada implementation and gtkada for the GUI.
However, the algorithm implementation is not the only thing that this project has going on, as it has
also a map generator integrated into it; meaning that the environnement in which the algorithm will
evolve is not static and is dynamically generated.

As it is my first time using gtkAda, I extensively relied on [the examples](https://github.com/AdaCore/gtkada/tree/master/testgtk)
provided.
